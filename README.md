# Weather-App
This is a prototype for the design of a weather app. At the top, the app displays all the most important information such as the time, live temperature, air quality, sunrise and sunset times, UV, the temperature it feels like, and the high and lows of the day. 

The middle section has an hourly forecast and an hourly forecast of another day that the user chooses (static as of now). There is a 10-day forecast in the bottom left and a live weather map in the bottom right.
